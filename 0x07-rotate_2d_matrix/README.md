# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

Given an `n` x `n` 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

## Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    The `rotate_2d_matrix` function takes a 2D matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise.
    The matrix is edited in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified.
    The function does not return anything.

    Constraints:
    - The matrix will have 2 dimensions.
    - The matrix will not be empty.
    """
